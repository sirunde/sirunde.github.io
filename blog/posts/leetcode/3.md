## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Description
> Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
> substring without repeating characters.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        highest = 0
        distance = 0
        j = 0
        lis = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if(s[i] in lis):
                j = max(lis[s[i]], j)

            distance = max(i-j +1, distance)
            lis[s[i]] = i+1

                
        return distance
```
