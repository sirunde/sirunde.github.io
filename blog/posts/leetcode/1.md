## 1. Two Sum

# Description
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
> You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:
```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

# Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int j = 0;
        
        vector<int> out;
        for (int i= 0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            j = target - nums[i];
            for (int z = i+1; z<nums.size(); z++){
                if (nums[z] == j){
                    out.push_back(i);
                    out.push_back(z);
                    return out;
                }
            }
        }

        std:cout << nums[0];
        return out;
    }
};
```

This code was my first attempt using c++.
Therefore, it was not optimized.
Since it was easy problem, I did not change anything, instead, moved to next.
If you use unordered_map, then it would be much faster.
