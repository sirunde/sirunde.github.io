## Problem
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        i = 1
        x = 0
        while(l1 != None):
            x += l1.val*i
            if l2 != None:
                x += l2.val*i
                l2 = l2.next
            l1 = l1.next
            i *= 10

        while(l2 != None):
            x += l2.val*i
            l2 = l2.next
            i *= 10

        x = str(x)
        output = None
        for i in (x):
            output = ListNode(int(i), output)
        return output
```
This answer is not optimized, but it was my first idea of solving this problem.

### Explaination
```python
while(l1 != None):
        x += l1.val*i
        if l2 != None:
            x += l2.val*i
            l2 = l2.next
        l1 = l1.next
        i *= 10
```
while loop was used to remove all the value from l1 and l2 at the same time. If l2 is None, it stop add value from l2.

```python
while(l2 != None):
    x += l2.val*i
    l2 = l2.next
    i *= 10
```
This while loop iterates the rest of value from l2, if l1 does not have any value, but l2 has.
This way, I can fully empty both lists.

```python
x = str(x)
output = None
for i in (x):
    output = ListNode(int(i), output)
return output
```

after that, I can iterate x and put it in linkedlist.
